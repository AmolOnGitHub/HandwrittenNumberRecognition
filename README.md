# HandwrittenNumberRecognition

Simple multi-layer neural network to recognise a number given in a 28x28px image.

Made from scratch (no pytorch/tensorflow, just numpy and math).

Augmented the training dataset by shifting, rotating, and zooming the data randomly to increase accuracy. 

Achieved 95.12% accuracy on the MNIST test dataset.
